    Hello! Welcome to my page! My name is Jon Bien Cuenca Alolod but everyone calls me Bien. 
    I am a first year student at Ritsumeikan University and I am currently with the basketball circle. 
    My position is Point Guard or Shooting Guard. 
    My original sport was actually swimming but I stopped because of the pandemic where all pools are closed. 
    I went into nationals and competed for freestyle and backstroke where I won 3rd place for freestyle but unfortunately for backstroke, I didn’t get into the top 3. 
    Anyways, let's talk about my roots! I am from the Philippines but my mom is Spanish so that counts as a half. 
    I arrived in Japan three years ago and that’s when I started my high school life here in Japan. 
    I learned to speak Japanese and was able to pass N3 in high school but I wasn’t able to take N2 because I was busy with the preparations for college. 
    I love the season of Autumn especially in Kyoto where I go every year and do sight seeing with my family in Kiyomizu dera. 
    Kyoto is the best place for me because I feel at peace especially in the mountains where everything is so quiet while looking at maple leaves. 
    Anyways that is all for me! Thank you for reading!
